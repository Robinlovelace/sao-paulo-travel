# Abstract

<<<<<<< HEAD
A skewed distribution of schools towards wealthy areas can result in a mismatch between the provision of educational opportunity and the need for access to education.
This mismatch can be further reinforced by poor transport provision in lower income areas.
In this paper, we develop a school accessibility index that captures both the unequal distribution of schools and transport services across space.
Our index combines information on the spatial distribution of children and adolescents by income categories, the location of existing schools, the travel patterns of students, and the travel infrastructure serving the school catchment area into a single measure of school accesibility. We use our index to measure school accessibility by areas across São Paulo, based on information from Population and School Censuses, Household Travel Surveys and electronic transit card records.
The results illustrate how existing inequalities are amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. 
We conclude that extending the concept of local accessibility indicators to the 'school commute' can guide the development of policies to reduce educational inequalities.

=======
Travel to school is an everyday reality for millions of young people around the world.
The mode, duration, safety, comfort and pollution levels of this trip has huge
impacts on the future generation, yet has received relatively little academic
attention.
Access to high quality quality schools is highly variable across geographical
space, making travel options are vital for ensuring a more equitable supply of
educational opportunity to diverse groups. Conversely, poor accessibility
to deprived area can reinforce social inequalities, with long-term implications.
Based on this emerging context, this paper develops a school accessibility index
for local areas.
This index is based on current travel patterns, local travel infrastructure serving the school
catchment and the provision of travel services such as public transport links.
Using data from the Sao Paulo Household Travel Survey (2007 and 2012), School Census
and electronic card data, we demonstrate how this index can be used
measure current provision and evaluate future interventions.
The results suggest that that school accessibility can
impact the social background of school attendees and
academic performance.
We conclude that extending the concept of local accessibility indicators
to the 'school commute' can ensure that transport decision makers take
equality and health impacts on young people into account.

Travel to school is an everyday reality for millions of young people around the world.
The mode, duration, safety, comfort and pollution levels of this trip has huge
impacts on the future generation, yet has received relatively little academic
attention.


Travel options are vital for ensuring a more equitable supply of
educational opportunity to diverse groups. Conversely, poor accessibility
to deprived area can reinforce social inequalities, with long-term implications.
Based on this emerging context, this paper develops a school accessibility index
for local areas.

The first well-known attempt to define accessibility quantitatively was by @ingram1971concept, which presented a range of measures related to distance (Euclidean and network), barriers and different functions representing distance decay.

This early work made the distinction between accessibility indeces that apply to zones or single 'desire lines':
"relative accessibility is defined as a measure of the effort of overcoming spatial separation between two points, while the integral accessibility is defined as a measure of the effort of overcoming spatial separation between a point and all other points within an area"
[@allen1993accesibility]. 

# Method: measuring school accessibility

We calculate three different accessibility measures for different modes: cumulative, gravitiy-based, and competitive.

The cumulative-opportunity measure for mode $M$ (Boisjoly and El-Geneidy, 2016) is defined as:

$$ CO_{i}^M= \sum_{j=1}^n(S_{j}f(C_{ij}) $$

$$ f(C_{ij}) = \left\{ 
                \begin{array}{ll}
                  1 if C_{ij}<=t\\
                  0 if C_{ij}<t
                \end{array}
              \right.
  $$ 

This measure counts the number of schools available from one area within a certain travel time by mode $M$ threshold. $C_{ij}$ is the travel cost (measured in time) between the centroid of zone i and the centroid of zone j. 

Gravity-based accessibility measure

In spite of its simplicity, Boisjoly and El-Geneidy (2016) have found that the cumulative-opportunity measure (using a 45 minute threshold) is highly correlated with a gravity-based accessibility measure ([@handy1997measuring], [@hansen1959accessibility]), defined as:

$$ A_{i}^M= \sum_{j=1}^n(S_{j}e^{\beta*C_{ij}}) $$

Where $A_{i}^M$ is the gravity accessibility at the centroid of area $i$ to all schools at area $j$ using mode $M$, and $\beta$ is a negative exponential cost function. The cost function, based on a negative exponential decay curve, includes reported number of school trips in the 2007 Origin-Destination Survey. (Here we can also use information from the school census on number of students per school to know how many students the area attracts). The proposed accessibility measure captures the fact that more proximate schools (S) are more attractive than those located further away. 

Competitive accessibility measure

The measures proposed above take into account the sptail distribution of schooling opportunities, but not the local demand for schooling. This is particularly relevant for our equity analysis, since it could be the case that higher areas are disproportionally served with respect to the number of potentail students living within a certain travel distance, whereas the opposite holds for lower-income areas.  In order to assess the mismatch between the demand and supply for schooling, we use the sum of students in schools in each area (the demand), and the sum of individuals within the school grade age-group living in each area (the supply) in the following competitive accessibility measure, first proposed by [@shen1998location] and adapted by El-Geneidy et al (2015):

$$ CA_{i}^M= \sum_{j=1}^n\frac{P_{j}-f(C_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^n(Y_{k}-f(C_{kj}))}$$

Where the numerator discounts the number of pupils in area $j$ $P_{j}$ by how far area $i$ is from area $j$ using the same function as before, and the denominator discounts the number of students (young adults) living in zone $k$ $Y_{k}$ by how far they are from area $j$. 
In this way, the discounted number of study places at each area is divided by the potential students available to fill those places, and then summed in order to obtain a single accessibility measure for each area $i$.  

In order to assess equality in access to schooling, we stratify our population of students in two student groups (we could do it for more income groups): the students living with a head of household who earns 1 minimum wage or less, and those living with a head of household who earns more than 1 minimum wage. The accessibility measures are based on student's travel times by different modes using data from the 2007 Origin-Destination survey. Alternatively, for the case of public transport, wet use actual transit times in 2015 for comparison (bilhete unico data?).
